        content-text="<p class=&quot;my-3&quot;>The Consumer has the right to withdraw from the contract, without providing reasons, 
        within 14 days from when they themselves or a third party appointed by them, received the product or (ii) in the case 
        of the purchase of multiple products delivered separately with a single order, from when they received the last product.
        </p>
        To exercise the right of withdrawal, the Consumer only needs to follow these instructions:
        <p class=&quot;my-3&quot;>Fill out the Return Form found in the package with which they received their order, indicating the product(s) 
          they intend to return. Please note that specifying the reason for the return, using the corresponding code listed in the table, 
          is not mandatory for exercising the right of withdrawal but it helps us in managing the return.
        </p>
        Package the product with original labels and tags, taking care not to damage them, and include the properly filled out Return Form 
        in the package. Affix the prepaid adhesive label from the Return Form on the package you intend to return the product with.
        <p class=&quot;my-3&quot;>Ship the package through one of the channels indicated in the Return Form.</p>
        The Consumer can track the package directly on the courier`s website using the tracking code provided in the Return Form.
        <p class=&quot;my-3&quot;>In case of misplacement of the Return Form, the Consumer is kindly requested to contact our Customer Care directly at 
          the email address info@alessandragrimoldi.com.
        </p>
        Alternatively, the Consumer may exercise the right of withdrawal by sending any explicit declaration to info@alessandragrimoldi.com 
        regarding their decision to withdraw, using the attached standard withdrawal form and following the instructions provided in the 
        withdrawal confirmation email they will receive.
        <p class=&quot;my-3&quot;>In the event of withdrawal, the Consumer will be refunded the payments made, including delivery costs (except for any 
          additional costs resulting from their choice of a type of delivery different from the less expensive standard delivery offered), 
          without undue delay and in any case no later than 14 days from the day we receive the decision to withdraw.
        </p>
       These refunds will be made using the same means of payment used for the initial transaction, unless a refund on a different means of payment 
       is requested. In this case, any additional costs resulting from the different means of payment chosen will be borne by the Consumer.
       <p class=&quot;my-3&quot;>The refund may be suspended until the goods are received or until proof is provided of having sent back the goods, 
        whichever is earlier.</p>
       If the Consumer has received the product and does not intend to use the return procedure provided in the Return Form included in the package 
       of their order, they are requested to return it to Alessandra Grimoldi at the address: Via Tiziano 21 – 20145 – Milano, without undue delay 
       and in any case, no later than 14 days from the day the withdrawal was communicated.
       <p class=&quot;my-3&quot;>The deadline is met if the goods are shipped before the expiration of the 14-day period.</p>
       The Consumer is only responsible for any decrease in the value of the goods resulting from handling other than that necessary to establish the nature, 
       characteristics, and functioning of the goods.
       <p class=&quot;my-3&quot;>Return for Defect or Non-Conformity</p>
       In the event of receiving incorrect or damaged items, the Consumer is responsible for reporting any defects and non-conformities within 2 (two) months 
       from the discovery. Notwithstanding the aforementioned deadline, it is possible to report any defects and non-conformities of the product within the 
       first 14 days from receiving the goods, using the form provided inside the package with which you received your order, following the instructions provided 
       in the same form.
       <p class=&quot;my-3&quot;>After 14 days from receiving the goods, the Consumer may in any case report the defect and/or non-conformity found, always within the 
        aforementioned 2 (two) month term from its discovery, by sending an email to our Customer Assistance at the address info@alessandragrimoldi.com.
       </p>
      We reserve the right to assess the defects and non-conformities reported by you and, after performing the necessary quality checks to verify the actual 
      non-conformity of the Product, we will provide feedback via email to the address provided during the registration process on the Site or when placing the order.
      <p class=&quot;my-3&quot;>In the event of a defect or non-conformity, the consumer will be entitled to repair or replacement of the product if explicitly requested; if 
        such remedies are impossible or excessively costly, as well as in other cases provided by law, the Consumer will be entitled to a refund of the price paid, using 
        the same means of payment used for the initial transaction.
      </p>
      In the event of returning items for which a defect and/or non-conformity has been confirmed within the terms and conditions outlined above, the shipping costs 
      related to the return of the product and, in case of repair or replacement, the delivery costs of the repaired or replaced product will be covered by us."
