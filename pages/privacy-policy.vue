    <p class="text-privacy">
      Suggested text: Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g.
      videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites
      behaves in exactly the same way as if the visitor had visited the other
      website.

    <p class="text-privacy">
      These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional
      third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with them, including

    <p class="text-privacy">
      If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained
      indefinitely. This is so we can automatically recognize and approve any
      subsequent comments instead of keeping them in a moderation queue.

      For users who register on our website (if any), we also store the personal
      information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit or
      delete their personal information at any time (except their username which
      they cannot change). Website administrators can also see and edit this
      information.

      request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about
      you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that
      we delete all personal data relating to you. This does not include data
